## Requirements for development environment

### Install npm

The easiest way to manage different node version in a development machine is making use of NVM (node version manager).

Use the information in their [GitHub](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating) to install NVM and install the node version v14.15.5.



## Development server

Run `ng serve --proxy-config proxy.conf.json` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Local Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Docker build
