# Deep Learning Image retrieval with Fashion Product database

The aim of the project is the creation of a tool that allows the full implementation and evaluation of an image retrieval web application using the [Fashion Product](https://www.kaggle.com/paramaggarwal/fashion-product-images-dataset) dataset as the database. DuSeveral existing pre-trained models are evaluated and also custom models are created from applying Transfer Learning from them.

The main idea is that a user can obtain the topK ranking products more similar to an image using one of the different models available.

The [Deep Fashion](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/DeepFashion.html) database is used to evaluate the system with more heterogeneous images (real world images) and finally used to obtain the best model as it is depicted in the evaluation results.

The original code is the Final Project delivery for the UPC [Artificial Intelligence with Deep Learning Postgraduate Course](https://www.talent.upc.edu/ing/estudis/formacio/curs/310401/postgraduate-course-artificial-intelligence-deep-learning/) 2020-2021 edition, authored by:

## General configuration


## Fashion product dataset

It is necessary to remove the following lines in the 'styles.csv' since they are missing images.

```
39425,Men,Apparel,Topwear,Tshirts,Red,Spring,2013,Casual,U.S. Polo Assn. Men Red Polo T-Shirt
39401,Men,Apparel,Bottomwear,Jeans,Blue,Winter,2016,Casual,U.S. Polo Assn. Denim Co. Men Blue Slim Straight Fit Jeans
12347,Men,Apparel,Topwear,Suits,Red,Winter,2010,Casual,Fastrack Men Red Manhattan Regular Fit Solid Formal Shirt

# Install dependencies

Step 1: Get Docker
```
The first step is installing the Docker Engine. Follow the steps in the
official page: 

[https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
```

Step 2: Get Docker Compose
```
Then install Docker Compose. 

[https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
```

# Build project

First of all export the environment variables DATASET_ROOT and WORKDIR_ROOT.


In the root folder execute:

```
docker-compose -p imageretrieval build
```

This will creaate the Docker image for the API and the Frontend (that also acts as a proxy for the API in the port 80).

## <a name="pretrainedmodel"></a>First experiment - Pretrained models
This experiment was the first step of our retrieval engine, we build a system that used pretrained models.
The expectation was to first of all get to know the dataset `product fashion` and train it with pretrained model to be able to identify the best model. Also we took this opportunity to improve the transform operations that we need to apply to the input images to improve the accuracy.
We have performed this experiment over 6 different models:
* vgg16
* resnet50
* inception_v3
* inception_resnet_v2
* densenet161
* efficient_net_b4

</br>

### Hypothesis
The expectation for the first experiment is that resnet50 and DenseNet161 would be the models to behave the best, based on some papers. For example in [this paper](https://www.ingentaconnect.com/contentone/ist/ei/2019/00002019/00000008/art00008?crawler=true&mimetype=application/pdf), resnet, vgg16 and densenet161 are mentioned as the most used models and with better performance. in this paper it is used as texture retrieval, something similar to our clothe retrieval system.

</br>

### Experiment setup
We have use as dataset Product Fashion, you have see a sample of the content in the following table.
id,gender,masterCategory,subCategory,articleType,baseColour,season,year,usage,productDisplayName
| id   | gender |  masterCategory |   subCategory |  articleType  | baseColour   |   season   |  year |   usage |  productDisplayName  |

The architecture of the models we have used is the described on the following images. 
   <img src="docs/imgs/vgg16_architecture.jpeg" width="100"/> 
   <img src="docs/imgs/resnet50_architecture.jpeg" width="100"/>
   <img src="docs/imgs/densenet161_architecture.jpeg" width="100"/>  
   (a) VGG-16, (b) ResNet-50, and (c) DenseNet-161 architectures
and feature extraction locations. 

However we included some customizations based on the results we so for our particular case of clothe retrieval.
* Changes that included in vgg16 model:
   ```
   model.model = nn.Sequential(
      model.model.features,
      nn.AdaptiveAvgPool2d((1,1)),
      nn.Flatten()
   )

   model.output_features = 512
   ```

* Changes that included in resnet50 model:
   ```
   model.model.fc = nn.Identity()

   model.model.layer4[2].relu = nn.Identity()

   model.output_features = 2048
   ```
* Changes that included in densenet161 model:
   ```
   model.model.classifier = nn.Identity()

   model.output_features = 2208
   ```
As you can see we have removed the classification layer fom all of the model in order convert them in feature extractors and also we have included the output_features value after using the feature extractor.

</br>

### Results

In the following table you can see what are the results based on mAP and precision hit, the results are sorted by precision hit.

As we expected the model that behave the best are densenet161, vgg16, resnet50. And we can also see that inception_v3 is on the top 3 models.
The model that gives best mAP is vgg16 and the model with best precision hit is densenet161.

| Model | DataSetSize | UsedFeatures | FeaturesSize | ProcessTime | mAPqueries | mAP | PrecisionHits |
|-------|------------:|-------------:|-------------:|------------:|-----------:|----:|--------------:|
|densenet161|5021|NormalizedFeatures|128|0:11:15|600|0,256|0,7514|
|vgg16|5021|NormalizedFeatures|128|0:10:25|600|0,273|0,7159|
